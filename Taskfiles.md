# 🛠 Taskfile — Project Automation Guide

This project uses [`Taskfile`](https://taskfile.dev/) to automate development, testing, and deployment workflows.
It acts like a modern Makefile — simple, cross-platform, and dependency-aware.

---

## 📦 Installation

Before using any tasks, make sure the [`task`](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) CLI tool is installed.

### Install Task
```bash
# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install task

# Or via script (recommended)
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)"
````

### Verify

```bash
task --version
```

---

## 🧭 Why Taskfile?

`Taskfile.yml` provides a **consistent and reproducible way** to manage your project:

* 🔁 Set up and sync Python environments with [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
* 🧪 Run data pipelines, model training, and evaluation
* 🧹 Clean the workspace safely
* 🚀 Deploy to Databricks or Streamlit
* ✅ Run pre-commit hooks and linting

No need to memorize long shell commands — just run:

```bash
task <task-name>
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies and create the environment

```bash
task install
task create-venv
task dev-install
```

### 2. Run preprocessing or training scripts

```bash
task run_process_data
task run_train_register_basic_model
```

### 3. Make predictions using a registered model

```bash
task run_predict_basic_model
```

### 4. Deploy and test serving endpoints

```bash
task run_deploy_basic_model_serving
task run_test_basic_model_serving
```

### 5. Run tests and lint checks

```bash
task test
task lint
```

### 6. Clean everything

```bash
task clean
```

## 🧹 Maintenance Commands

### Clean your environment

```bash
task clean
```

Removes:

* `.venv/`, `_artifact/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`
* `__pycache__`, `.egg-info/`
* Node modules and coverage artifacts

### Count lines of code per file (identifying big files)

```bash
task qa-lines-count
```

Displays the number of lines per `.py` file, sorted ascending.

## 🧠 Tips & Best Practices

* Always run `task dev-install` after editing dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
* Use `task test` locally before pushing changes to ensure builds and tests pass.
* Use `task lint` locally before pushing changes to ensure code is properly linted.
* Ensure your `~/.databrickscfg` file is configured before running Databricks tasks.
* You can reuse these tasks in CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example: GitHub Actions
- name: Run tests
  run: task test
```
